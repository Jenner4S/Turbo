 *    KalViewController
 *    ------------------------
 *
 *  KalViewController automatically creates both the calendar view
 *  and the events table view for you. The only thing you need to provide
 *  is a KalDataSource so that the calendar system knows which days to
 *  mark with a dot and which events to list under the calendar when a certain
 *  date is selected (just like in Apple's calendar app).
